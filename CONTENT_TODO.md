## Content Collection Guidelines

### For Photography
**Best Practices:**
- Shoot in high resolution (minimum 1920x1080px, prefer 4K)
- Use natural lighting when possible (golden hour for outdoor shots)
- Ensure consistent style across similar photo types (e.g., all headshots same background)
- Include variety (different angles, perspectives, subjects)
- Get signed release forms BEFORE taking photos

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Low resolution/pixelated images
- Inconsistent lighting/color grading
- Visible branding from other institutions
- Dated technology/equipment in photos
- Missing or incomplete metadata

### For Video
**Best Practices:**
- Minimum 1080p, prefer 4K for future-proofing
- Clear audio (use external mic, avoid background noise)
- Stable footage (use tripod or gimbal)
- Good lighting (three-point lighting for testimonials)
- Include B-roll footage (campus, activities, etc.)
- Create both Indonesian and English versions (voiceover/subtitles)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Poor audio quality (echoes, background noise)
- Shaky handheld footage
- Bad lighting (too dark, harsh shadows)
- Too long (keep testimonials under 60 seconds)
- Missing captions/subtitles

### For Written Content
**Best Practices:**
- Use active voice, clear language
- Maintain consistent tone (professional but approachable)
- Proofread for grammar, spelling, accuracy
- Include specific details and examples
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max for web)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include relevant keywords for SEO

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overly formal/academic language
- Vague statements without specifics
- Grammatical errors
- Inconsistent terminology
- Too long/dense paragraphs

### For Data & Statistics
**Best Practices:**
- Verify accuracy with official sources
- Include date/time period for stats (e.g., "as of 2024" or "last 5 years")
- Cite sources internally for reference
- Update regularly (set reminders)
- Present in digestible formats (charts, infographics)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Outdated statistics
- Unverified/estimated numbers presented as facts
- Missing context (what period, what sample size)
- Inconsistent metrics across pages
